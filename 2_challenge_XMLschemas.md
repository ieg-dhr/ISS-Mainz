a) history of the collection and its infrastructure 

b) focus in Letters 1916-1923 is on encoding metadata

show frontend, backend and exported XML file

c) elements of the Letters 1916 schema are both adaptable to other collections of letters and project-specific:

Solution in the new infrastructure: "consecutive disambiguation"

# Task: 

Imagine that you are asked to create a digital edition of judicial regulations published in Mainz.

If you are able to read early modern print, look at the digitised [Untergerichts-Ordnung des Ertzstiffts Meyntz, Mainz, 1543](https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0002/bsb00029454/images/) and try to come up with elements that ought to be included in the schema for your digital edition.

What information must be included in every XML file created for a collection of early modern judicial regulations of this kind? What information is optional?
What "values" must be provided in normalised form, what "values" can be entered in several variations, reflecting usage in the original source?

You might want to put your considerations in a table and describe your thought process in a short text. The IEG DH Lab would be delighted to feature your contributions on our [blog](https://dhlab.hypotheses.org/).
