## Options for self-study: challenges of editing diverse, ambiguous or incomplete historical sources

Based on two case studies, ISS participants are invited to complete optional tasks in digital editing and email their results to Monika and Jaap. We would be delighted to present the participants' findings and considerations on our [research blog](https://dhlab.hypotheses.org/). 

* Case Study 1: normalising person names and place names in the 1st XML/TEI schema of the [Letters 1916-1923](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/) project

-> TASK: define schema elements for a potential edition of early modern court regulations from Mainz

* Case Study 2: the challenges of creating annotations for the [Edward B. Littlehales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRslCtTPpzc&feature=youtu.be) edition

-> TASK: establish criteria for annotations in a potential digital edition of mid-19th century religious texts from Mainz

Instructions will be provided in written form.
