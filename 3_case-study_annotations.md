# Case Study: Annotation choices in the "Littlehales" project

The project "Inside Dublin Castle - the correspondence of Edward Baker Littlehales, 1808" is a small digital edition prepared by MA students of Digitial Humanities at the Centre for Digital Humanities in Maynooth, Ireland, in the winter term of 2017/2018. The edition consists in letters exchanged between Edward Baker Littlehales, a British government official working at Dublin Castle, and two of his colleagues in the summer of 1808, covering rural uprisings in Ireland and other political issues of the day.

Although the project focussed on a limited amount of letters from a much larger collection held at the Maynooth University Library, deciding how to annotate those sources wasn't easy. Some of the letters were several pages long and contained many names of places and people as well as technical terms relating to early 19th-century government policy in Ireland. In most cases, we did not know at first who the people mentioned were and had to create a "dramatis personae" to identify those that were most important. As for place names, it was often difficult to handle inconsistent or old-fashioned spelling. And the students had to learn more about the overall context of the Irish Act of Union and the British rule in Ireland to contextualise the events mentioned in the letters.

The following video gives you an idea of how the project progressed and what challenges the team met:

During the time of this correspondence, Joseph Pollock was the role holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Lord Chancellor is a senior member of the Cabinet heading the Ministry of Justice as the Secretary of State for Justice. During 1808, Scott was frequently updated on civil affairs in Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| role   | role05  | Lord Lieutenant of Ireland            | The Lord Lieutenant was the representative for the King in Ireland, and as such, was the ranking governor from the Williaminite Wars (1690) until Irish independence (1921). Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond held the role from 1807-1813.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| role   | role06  | Solicitor General                     | The Solicitor General of Ireland was the senior advisor and deputy of the Attorney General, advising the Crown on Irish legal matters. Charles Kendal Bushe occupied this role from 1805-1822.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Org    | org01   | Dublin Castle                         | Dublin Castle was, until 1922, the centre of the United Kingdom's government and a potent symbol of British rule. It was home to the administrative branch of the Irish government under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Org    | org03   | Yeomanry                              | Forces raised from the civilian population across the United Kingdom to free the regular army and militia from peacekeeping and to augment forces in the case of a French invasion. In Ireland the Yeomanry were raised in 1798 and were instrumental in putting down the 1798 Rebellion. Although meant to be an interdenominational force, they were substantially Protestant. Their tasks included home defence and riot control.                                                                      |
| Org    | org04   | Militia                               | The Irish Militia, originally established in 1661, was by 1776 largely defunct. It was re-established in 1793 due to the threat of an invasion from France, with each county having its own battalions or regiments. The militia was raised from the civilian population to augment the regular army in times of civil unrest or for national emergencies.                                                                                                                                                |
| event  | event01 | Manchester Riots                      | In May and June 1808 there were large demonstrations in Manchester protesting the rejection of the fixing of the minimum wage bill in parliament. Joseph Hanson, a local middle class merchant and radical thinker, spoke to the crowd, despite orders by the military to stand down. He was tried in the spring 1909 assizes in Lancaster. But in the meantime, the Irish authorities were fearful that he had travelled to Dublin to incite the local population.                                       |

Described at the time as outrages or disturbances, these tended to be local in nature and against the landed classes. In summer 1808 there were a number of such events in North Kerry and West Limerick. The shifting position on these events as evidenced from the correspondence from Dublin Castle demonstrates how difficult it was officials in Dublin to get a handle on the severity and expanse of these events. |

Local magistrates could only apprehend one offender because Dublin Castle procrastinated. Disappointed with legal procedures all over the country, influential Catholics convened at Clonmell in August 1808 to pass a formal resolution to the Lord Lieutenant.                                                                                                               |
| event  | event05 | Banishment Act of 1697                | Passed to protect the Church of Ireland, the Act required the banishment of all regular clergy, bishops and others exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Other clergy were permitted to remain, but an act of 1704 required registration with authorities, limited their number and forbade further entry into the kingdom. The Banishment Act directly affected the practice of the catholic religion in Ireland.                                                                                      |
| event  | event06 | Insurrections                         | In the British legal system, the classification of popular unrest was controversially debated throughout the early modern period. The term "disturbance" was often used for trespasses on property. "Outrages" were acts of violence committed by larger groups of people. If a formal Riot Act or Insurrection Act was read in a region of unrest, offenders faced severe punishment in a criminal trial.                                                                                                |

Charles IV of Spain was replaced by Napoleon's brother in 1808. Britain supported anti-Napoleonic forces in Spain and Skandinavia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| place  | pla02   | France during the reign of Napoleon   | Under Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, France became exceedingly powerful and established a vast empire of dependent states. The Napoleonic Wars fought between 1803 and 1815 were a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain was France's major opponent at sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The annotations highlight the political nature of Edward B. Littlehales's correspondence and shed light on the challenges met by the Anglo-Irish administration in the years immediately following the dissolution of the Irish Parliament. Ireland's (postal) infrastructure, trade, the press or Littlehales's personal relations were, for the purpose of creating a consistent edition with a "unique selling point", not covered in our edition. At some point, someone interested in the family connections between members of the Anglo-Irish upper class might create a very different edition of the Littlehales letters, perhaps linking them with material from other archives. Annotations are always a matter of choice, closely linked with research questions pursued by the editors. It is important to make these choices transparent in the introduction to the edition and in all scholarly publications resulting from it.

# Task:

Imagine that you have been asked to create a digital edition of the texts that were printed in the course of the mid-19th-century "Jesuit controversy" in Mainz.
The cause of the controvery was that the Jesuits had been given charge of the parish church St. Christoph's ("Christophskirche"), which is now a World War II ruin and memorial in the inner-city. Many citizens of Mainz were suspicious of the Jesuit order and filed complaints. The city council's grievances were, for instance, discussed by the Catholic Bishop Mainz, [Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler](https://www.regionalgeschichte.net/bibliothek/biographien/ketteler-wilhelm-emmanuel-von.html).

Read Ketteler's address [Die Jesuiten in Mainz und die Beschwerde des Gemeinderathes bei den hohen Ständen gegen deren Aufenthalt in der Pfarrwohnung zu St. Christoph : Ansprache an seine Diöcesanen](https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de//de/fs1/object/display/bsb10568409_00005.html) of 1864 and try to find out who the major agents in the controversy were. What places, actions, political regulations or theological concepts are mentioned more than once? Which of those would you annotate in a digital edition of similar texts?
